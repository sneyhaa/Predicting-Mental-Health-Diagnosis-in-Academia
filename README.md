# Predicting-Mental-Health-Diagnosis-in-Academia

Overview
This project addresses the pressing issue of mental health among university students by introducing a predictive model for diagnosing mental illnesses. Leveraging machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, the model achieves an impressive 82% accuracy. Through careful feature selection, 35 key survey questions are identified, streamlining the prediction process.
