# Predicting Mental Health Diagnosis in Academia

## Overview
This project addresses the critical issue of mental health among university students by developing a predictive model for diagnosing mental illnesses. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, the model achieves an impressive 82% accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Through careful feature selection, we've narrowed down the survey to 35 key questions, streamlining the prediction process and enhancing efficiency.

## Key Features
- Machine learning-based prediction of mental health diagnoses
- Utilizes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network algorithms
- Achieves 82% accuracy in identifying at-risk university students
- Feature selection narrows down the survey to 35 key questions for efficient prediction
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of student mental health surveys, containing various features related to students' mental well-being and lifestyle factors. The original dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and irrelevant features.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values
- Removing irrelevant features
- Encoding categorical variables
2. Feature Selection:
- Using Decision Tree and Random Forest feature importance
- Selecting features based on importance thresholds
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
4. Performance Metrics:
- ROC AUC Score
- Accuracy Score

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 82%
Feature importance analysis revealed the most significant factors contributing to mental health diagnoses
The project successfully reduced the number of survey questions from over 100 to 35, maintaining high predictive power
